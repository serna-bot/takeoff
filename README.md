# TAKEOFF
Takeoff is an interactive simulator game where you can control a helicopter and explore a dynamic city map. Your goal is to navigate the city without crashing into the sides of any buildings or running out of fuel. When your gas gets low, there are refuel blocks randomly generated on the tops of buildings that you can land on to get a full tank refuel. Upon crashing into a building, your helicopter explodes and you restart in the middle of a newly generated city map. Additionally, refreshing the simulator will generate a new city, with randomly placed buildings, textures and refuel blocks.
